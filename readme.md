# Celiac Pass
An Objective-C app that retrieves a user's geolocation and display a message about Celiac Disease in the primary language of the user's current country. Python files use the Microsoft Translation API to create maps in Objective-C syntax from country codes to translations, and from country names to country codes.

Additionally allows the user to input a country of their choice, and provides them with a list displayed in a tableview of countries for which a translation is available.
